# Urban Event Detection
for my paper (I'm going to submit it)

- In this work, we propose a novel graph-based approach to consider geo-spatial characteristics. We consider the region dynamics over different time unit so, our approach increases performance because it help learn the model by giving less weight to sensor data belonging to region with abnormal dynamics over each time unit

- By constructing a region graph by each time zone, spatial outlier is assigned to sensor data belonging to the region with abnormal urban dynamics

- Then, the sensor data have less weight on training step for a detection model
